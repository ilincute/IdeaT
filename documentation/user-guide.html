        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            Nutrics is a multi-device adaptive and customizable tool – i.e. a (mobile) Web browser extension – able to determine (e.g. learn)
            and recommend the ideal weekday and time for performing a set of desired actions in a specific context. The main group of
            targeted audience for this application would be people with diabetes. This extension will allow the user to insert a daily 
            glycemic index (GI) which will determine if the blood sugar is either high or low. The GI will be the key factor based on which 
            the user will receive receipe recommendations. Also, the user can consult the available calendar from the application,
            so that he can schedule his doctor appointments or other type of activities.

        <h1>Architecture </h1>
        <p>
         The application is written in JavaScript. Also, we used chart.js library for generating the charts that indicate the flow of the glycemix index
         of the user, as well as his mood. </p>
         <h1>Development stage </h1>    
        <p>
          The main development stages are the following:
          <ul>
          	<li>Building the metrics logic, with the help of JavaScript (the input is kept in the localStorage)
            </li>
            <li>As for the front-end, we used HTML and CSS, as well as Bootstrap framework. For the header, we used JavaScript, so it can be 
                easier to manipulate the responsiveness of the pages. We also used unDraw for the illustration on the home page.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Welcome Page</h2>
        <figure typeof="sa:Image">
        	<img src="../images/welcome.png" width="880" height="655">
        </figure>
        <p>
            This is the first contact of the user with the Nutrics application. On the left side, there are a few phrases that describe what is
            the purpose of the application, while on the right side the user can choose one of the four ways to connect to our application: Google,
            Facebook, Instagram or LinkedIn.

        <h2>Home</h2>

        <p>
            This is the home page, the first page the user will see after having managed to log in with one of the four social media accounts 
            he/she has. On the right side, there is a question the user can answer (it is entirely up to him), in order to keep track of his 
            mood. He can check out the state of his mood for the last couple of days from the chart available at the Metrics page. He can choose
            from: 
        	<ul>
        		<li><strong>first icon</strong>, which means very satisfied</li>
        		<li><strong>second icon</strong>, which means satisfied</li>
        		<li><strong>third icon</strong>, which means dissatisfied</li>

            </figure>
        <p>
            Once he has clicked on one of the three icons available on the previous page, the user can click on the Metrics page, in order to
            introduce his glycemic index and verify the flow of his GI from the last couple of days.

            </figure>
        <p>
            This is the calendar page, where the user can pin his upcoming events (e.g. doctor appointment). 
      </section>

      <h2>Recipes</h2>
        <figure typeof="sa:Image">
                <img src="../images/recipes-overview.png" width="880" height="655">
            </figure>
        <p>
            This is the section where the user can ask the application to suggest him appropriate recipes for him, based on the glycemic index
            he has introduced in the Metrics page and the meal of the day he chooses. There are four different types of meals:
        	<ul>
        		<li>Breakfast</li>
        		<li>Lunch</li>
                <li>Dinner</li>

            </figure>
        <p>
            In case the user would like to change the settings of his profile or the settings of the application, he can click on the user icon, 
            from the top right corner, which will lead him to the Settings page. He can upload a different profile picture if he wants, change his 
            first or last name, his age or he can choose from one of the application settings, such as: having the app send him a notification
            in case of on an upcoming event.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            In a time when apps have taken over the kitchen, it is no wonder why people spend more time on their devices, rather then searching 
            for a recipe in an actual cookbook. Nutrics is an application easy to use, which gives users suggestions of the ideal meal they
        should eat, based on their glycemix index and according to the preferred meal of the day. It is also a great organiser for the upcoming
        events the user has planned in their schedule</p>
