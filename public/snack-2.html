  "Step 1: Preheat oven to 350° F / 180 °C.",
  "Step 2: Slice eggplant very thin - this is the trickiest part. If you have a mandoline, definitely use it. If not, do the best you can to get thin (⅛ in) uniform, consistent slices. If they are too thick, they won’t crisp up.",
  "Step 3: Sprinkle with sea salt and let them ‘sweat’ (draw out water) for about 30 minutes. Take some paper towels and soak up as much water as you can (this step is not necessary, but the less water, the easier they will crisp up).",
  "Step 4: Spray a baking dish with the cooking spray - alternatively you could line the pan with foil or parchment paper and spray that for easier clean up as some of the gooey middle might stick - and place the eggplant slices on the pan being careful not to overlap.",
  "Step 5: Lightly spray the tops and sprinkle with spices of your choice.",
  "Step 6: Bake for 20 minutes, then flip slices and bake an additional 10-20 minutes or until they begin to brown and curl up. They should be starting to harden a bit, and may still feel a little soft, but will crisp up very nicely a few minutes out of the oven."
